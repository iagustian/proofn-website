            <h1><strong>Terms of Service</strong></h1>
			<p>Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms") carefully. By downloading, accessing, or using the mobile applications, websites, or other items or services of Myabuy, LLC and our affiliates ("Proofn ", "we" or "us"), or the services, features, or functionality jointly offered with other companies through our mobile application or website (collectively, the "Services"), you (&ldquo;Proofn User&rdquo;, &ldquo;Proofn Account&rdquo;, &ldquo;you&rdquo;, or &ldquo;your&rdquo;) agree to be bound by these Terms. These Terms affect your legal rights and obligations, so if you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Services.</p>
			<p><strong>Modification to the Agreement</strong></p>
			<p>We reserve the right to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time, effective upon posting the amended terms on this site. If we make changes, we will notify you by, at a minimum, revising the &ldquo;Last Updated&rdquo; date at the top of this Agreement. You are responsible for regularly reviewing this Agreement. Continued use of Proofn after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. If you do not agree to any such changes you may not use or access the Proofn Services.</p>
			<p><strong>Payments</strong></p>
			<p>You agree that any amounts charged after the 90-day risk free trial ends, following a order to send an unlimited number of Proofn emails and unlimited Business Proofn emails to selected contact(s) after you designate more than five contacts as a &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; (a &ldquo;Charge&rdquo;) is due and payable immediately upon completion of the order. Charges include order Fees and other applicable fees, surcharges, and taxes that may apply.</p>
			<p><strong>Taxes</strong></p>
			<p>You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining (i) your applicable Tax reporting requirements, and (ii) the Taxes that should be included, and for including Taxes to be collected or obligations relating to applicable Taxes in Listings. You are also solely responsible for remitting to the relevant authority any Taxes included or received by you. Proofn cannot and does not offer Tax-related advice to any Account.</p>
			<p><strong>Earn Points For Sending Non-Proofn Email, Proofn Email and Business Proofn Email </strong></p>
			<p>You will receive one point for every non-Proofn email you sent, two points for every Proofn email you sent and can change at anytime later and three points for every &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; contact that you sent Business Proofn email too. When you accumulate 720 points, we will automatically send a birthday wish on your behalf on the birth date of each &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; contact, as determined by information from that &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; contact&rsquo;s Profile.</p>
			<p>When you accumulate 1440 points we will</p>
			<p>send your &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; contacts a holiday greeting, on your behalf, on major local holidays celebrated in countries where your &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; are located. We use your &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; contact mobile device GPS to determine holidays most relevant to your &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; contact. We have sole discretion to determine the dates that are considered major local holidays.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>When you accumulate 3600 points, we will automatically send you an audible alert, 5 minutes before we estimate your &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; contact will open the email you sent and ask if you want to make any changes on the email you sent to your &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; contact, before your &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; opens your email.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>When you accumulate 360,000 points, you will receive two points for every non-Proofn email you sent, four points for every Proofn email you sent and six points for every Business Proofn email you change or remove later.</p>
			<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong></p>
			<p>You agree not to use any technical, financial, strategic and other proprietary and confidential information relating to Proofn&rsquo;s business, operations and properties, including User information (&ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo;) disclosed to you by Proofn for your own use or for any purpose other than as contemplated herein. You shall not disclose or permit disclosure of any Confidential Information to third parties. You agree to take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure or use of Confidential Information of Proofn in order to prevent it from falling into the public domain. Notwithstanding the above, you shall not have liability to Proofn with regard to any Confidential Information which you can prove: was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed by Proofn or has entered the public domain through no fault of yours; was known to you, without restriction, at the time of disclosure, as demonstrated by files in existence at the time of disclosure; is disclosed with the prior written approval of Proofn; becomes known to you, without restriction, from a source other than Proofn without breach of this Agreement by you and otherwise not in violation of Proofn&rsquo;s rights; or is disclosed pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body; provided, however, that You shall provide prompt notice of such court order or requirement to Proofn to enable Proofn to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent or restrict such disclosure.</p>
			<p><strong>No Agency</strong></p>
			<p>You and Proofn are independent contractors, and no agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchisor-franchisee relationship is intended or created by this Agreement.</p>
			<p><strong>User Content</strong></p>

			<p>When you first create a Proofn account, we ask for your mobile number and email address to verify your account.

			<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>
			<p>THE SERVICES AND THE PROOFN CONTENT ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN ADDITION, WHILE PROOFN ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A GOOD USER EXPERIENCE, WE CANNOT AND DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS BE SECURE OR ERROR-FREE OR THAT THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS FUNCTION WITHOUT DELAYS, DISRUPTIONS, OR IMPERFECTIONS.</p>
			<p><strong>Note to International Users</strong></p>
			<p>The Services are hosted in the United States. If you are a user accessing the Services from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Services, which are governed by U.S. law, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer.</p>
			<p><strong>Disputes</strong></p>
			<p><strong>1) Indemnification</strong></p>
			<p>By agreeing to these Terms you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Proofn, our managing members, shareholders, employees, affiliates, licensors, and suppliers (the "Proofn Parties") from and against any and all complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) any User Content you post, upload, use, distribute, store, or otherwise transmit through the Services; (c) your violation of these Terms; (d) your violation of the rights of another, including without limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, privacy, or propriety right; or (e) your violation of any statutes, codes, ordinances, laws, rules, regulations, including without limitation, all regulatory, administrative, and legislative authorities.</p>
			<p><strong>2) Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
			<p>Except where prohibited by law, in no event will Proofn or the Proofn Parties be liable for any indirect, special, punitive, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages that result from (a) the use of, or inability to use, the Services; (b) the provision of the Services or any materials available therein; or (c) the conduct of other users of the Services, even if Proofn has been advised of the possibility of such damages. You assume total responsibility for your use of the Services. Your only remedy against Proofn for dissatisfaction with the Services or any content is to stop using the Services. If, notwithstanding these Terms, Proofn is found liable to you for any damage or loss that arises out of or is in any way connected with your use of the Services or any content, Proofn&rsquo;s liability shall in no event exceed $1.00. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of liability, so the foregoing limitation may not apply to you.</p>
			<p><strong>Forum and Venue</strong></p>
			<p>A lawsuit, if any, by you or Proofn against the other will occur in state or federal court in New Castle County, Delaware. You and Proofn agree that the jurisdiction and venue of these courts is exclusive.</p>
			<p><strong>Applicable Law</strong></p>
			<p>Any dispute between you and Proofn will be governed by these Terms and the laws of the State of Delaware and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict-of-laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.</p>
			<p><strong>Severability</strong></p>
			<p>If any provision of these Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
			<p><strong>Complete Agreement</strong></p>
			<p>These Terms supersede all prior understandings regarding the same and represent the complete agreement between you and Proofn. These Terms do no create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights. We may change or modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion. If we make changes to these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes, such as by sending a notification, posting a notice on the Services, or updating the "Last Updated" date above. Your continued use of the Services will confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms. We encourage you to frequently review the Terms to ensure you understand the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Services. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop using the Services and delete your Proofn account.</p>
