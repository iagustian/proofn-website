            <h1><strong>Terms of Service</strong></h1>
			<p>Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms") carefully. By downloading, accessing, or using the mobile applications, websites, or other items or services of Myabuy, LLC and our affiliates ("Proofn ", "we" or "us"), or the services, features, or functionality jointly offered with other companies through our mobile application or website (collectively, the "Services"), you (&ldquo;Proofn User&rdquo;, &ldquo;Proofn Account&rdquo;, &ldquo;you&rdquo;, or &ldquo;your&rdquo;) agree to be bound by these Terms. These Terms affect your legal rights and obligations, so if you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Services.</p>
			<p><strong>Modification to the Agreement</strong></p>
			<p>We reserve the right to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time, effective upon posting the amended terms on this site. If we make changes, we will notify you by, at a minimum, revising the &ldquo;Last Updated&rdquo; date at the top of this Agreement. You are responsible for regularly reviewing this Agreement. Continued use of Proofn after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. If you do not agree to any such changes you may not use or access the Proofn Services.</p>
			<p><strong>Payments</strong></p>
			<p>You agree that any amounts charged after the 90-day risk free trial ends, following a order to send an unlimited number of Proofn emails and unlimited Business Proofn emails to selected contact(s) after you designate more than five contacts as a &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; (a &ldquo;Charge&rdquo;) is due and payable immediately upon completion of the order. Charges include order Fees and other applicable fees, surcharges, and taxes that may apply.</p>
			<p><strong>Taxes</strong></p>
			<p>You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining (i) your applicable Tax reporting requirements, and (ii) the Taxes that should be included, and for including Taxes to be collected or obligations relating to applicable Taxes in Listings. You are also solely responsible for remitting to the relevant authority any Taxes included or received by you. Proofn cannot and does not offer Tax-related advice to any Account.</p>
			<p><strong>Earn Points For Sending Non-Proofn Email, Proofn Email and Business Proofn Email </strong></p>
			<p>You will receive one point for every non-Proofn email you sent, two points for every Proofn email you sent and can change at anytime later and three points for every &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; contact that you sent Business Proofn email too. When you accumulate 720 points, we will automatically send a birthday wish on your behalf on the birth date of each &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; contact, as determined by information from that &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; contact&rsquo;s Profile.</p>
			<p>When you accumulate 1440 points we will</p>
			<p>send your &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; contacts a holiday greeting, on your behalf, on major local holidays celebrated in countries where your &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; are located. We use your &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; contact mobile device GPS to determine holidays most relevant to your &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; contact. We have sole discretion to determine the dates that are considered major local holidays.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>When you accumulate 3600 points, we will automatically send you an audible alert, 5 minutes before we estimate your &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; contact will open the email you sent and ask if you want to make any changes on the email you sent to your &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; contact, before your &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; opens your email.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>When you accumulate 360,000 points, you will receive two points for every non-Proofn email you sent, four points for every Proofn email you sent and six points for every Business Proofn email you change or remove later.</p>
			<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong></p>
			<p>You agree not to use any technical, financial, strategic and other proprietary and confidential information relating to Proofn&rsquo;s business, operations and properties, including User information (&ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo;) disclosed to you by Proofn for your own use or for any purpose other than as contemplated herein. You shall not disclose or permit disclosure of any Confidential Information to third parties. You agree to take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure or use of Confidential Information of Proofn in order to prevent it from falling into the public domain. Notwithstanding the above, you shall not have liability to Proofn with regard to any Confidential Information which you can prove: was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed by Proofn or has entered the public domain through no fault of yours; was known to you, without restriction, at the time of disclosure, as demonstrated by files in existence at the time of disclosure; is disclosed with the prior written approval of Proofn; becomes known to you, without restriction, from a source other than Proofn without breach of this Agreement by you and otherwise not in violation of Proofn&rsquo;s rights; or is disclosed pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body; provided, however, that You shall provide prompt notice of such court order or requirement to Proofn to enable Proofn to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent or restrict such disclosure.</p>

			<p>By agreeing to these Terms you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Proofn, our managing members, shareholders, employees, affiliates, licensors, and suppliers (the "Proofn Parties") from and against any and all complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) any User Content you post, upload, use, distribute, store, or otherwise transmit through the Services; (c) your violation of these Terms; (d) your violation of the rights of another, including without limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, privacy, or propriety right; or (e) your violation of any statutes, codes, ordinances, laws, rules, regulations, including without limitation, all regulatory, administrative, and legislative authorities.</p>

			<p><strong>Severability</strong></p>
			<p>If any provision of these Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
			<p><strong>Complete Agreement</strong></p>
			<p>These Terms supersede all prior understandings regarding the same and represent the complete agreement between you and Proofn. These Terms do no create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights. We may change or modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion.
