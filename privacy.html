            <h1><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h1>
			<p>Last Updated: August 23, 2015</p>
			<p>Proofn is a fast and fun way to send email with your friends, colleagues and contacts. Users can attach photos or documents to friends, send email that cannot be edited once sent (Non-Proofn email), send email that can be edited or deleted at anytime (Proofn email) and send email that can be edited or deleted before the intended recipient opens the email (Business Proofn email)</p>
			<p>This privacy policy describes how we (Myabuy LLC, 360notion website, &ldquo;Proofn&rdquo; mobile application and our subsidiaries) collect, use, and share your information whenever you use our Services. Those Services include every way you might interact with us: through our websites, mobile applications, and any of our other online items and services that link to this privacy policy.</p>
			<p><strong>Modification to Privacy Policy</strong></p>
			<p>We reserve the right to modify the privacy policy and conditions at any time, effective upon posting the amended privacy policy terms on this site. If we make changes, we will notify you by, at a minimum, revising the &ldquo;Last Updated&rdquo; date at the top of this Agreement. You are responsible for regularly reviewing this Agreement. Continued use of Proof after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. If you do not agree to any such changes you may not use or access the Proofn Services.</p>
			<p><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>
			<p><strong>What You Directly Provide Us</strong></p>
			<p>To create a Proofn account, we need to collect a few important details about you: your full name, a password, an email address we can contact you at, a mobile phone number, your age or date of birth and after your 90 day free trial ends, your debit or credit card number. For additional Services beyond the Proofn account, we may ask you for additional information. We want you to be in control of your information, so we let you update or correct most of the basic Proofn account information by editing your account settings within Proofn. And while we hope you&rsquo;ll remain a lifelong Proofn User, if for some reason you ever want to delete your account, you can click the deletion link; but keep in mind that we may retain certain information in backup for a limited period of time or as required by law. For more information about how we store and delete email you send or receive through Proofn, please read the &ldquo;Edit, Delete or Remove Sent Email&rdquo; and &ldquo;Edit, Delete or Remove Sent Email to &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; Contacts&rdquo; section further down.</p>
			<p><strong>What You Automatically Provide Us When You Use Our Services</strong></p>
			<p>Because Proofn is about making it easy to retroactively change the email you send and help you convey your exact thoughts, there is some information we collect automatically when you access our Services, which we use to facilitate the broad range of communications offered through our Services, to provide you cool features and functionality, and to enable all the other purposes described in this privacy policy. We explain all this below:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong> Usage Information.</strong> We collect information about your activity and the email you send and receive through our Services. For example, we collect information such as the time, date, sender, recipient of a email, the number of email you exchange with your friends, which friends you exchange email with the most, and your interactions with email (such as when you open a email or capture a screenshot).</li>
			<li><strong> Content Information.</strong> Please check out the &ldquo;&ldquo;Edit, Delete or Remove Sent Email&rdquo; and &ldquo;Edit, Delete or Remove Sent Email to &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; Contacts&ldquo; sections in this privacy policy; it gives you more information about the email content we collect, how long we keep it, and how long third parties may have access to it.</li>
			<li><strong> Device Information.</strong> We collect information about your device, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers (including MAC address and IMEI), browser type and language, email type, mobile device phone number, and mobile network information. We also collect certain device information that will help us diagnose problems in the (hopefully rare) event you experience any crash or other problem while using our Services. So, for example, if we detect a crash or other problematic event, we may collect the list of apps on your device and other information about your device&rsquo;s performance at the time of the event for troubleshooting purposes.</li>
			<li><strong> Device Phonebook and Email Account.</strong> Because Proofn is all about communicating with friends, in order to access and use the features of the Service, you acknowledge and agree that you will have to provide Proofn with your mobile phone number and email address. You expressly acknowledge and agree that in order to provide the Service, Proofn may periodically access your contact list and phone and email address book on your mobile device to find and keep track of mobile phone numbers and email addresses of other users of the Service. When providing your mobile phone number or email address, you must provide accurate and complete information. You hereby give your express consent to Proofn to access your contact list and phone and email address book for mobile phone numbers and email addresses in order to provide and use the Service. We do not collect addresses, just contact names, mobile phone numbers and email addresses. You are solely responsible for the content you submit on Proofn. You must notify Proofn immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your mobile phone and/or mobile device. Although Proofn will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for the losses of Proofn or others due to such unauthorized use.</li>
			<li><strong> Location Information.</strong> With your consent, we collect your device location so that you can use our location-based features, and for any other purpose described in this privacy policy. As with your phonebook, email accounts and photos, you can always revoke your consent by changing the settings or preferences on your device. If you do so, certain features of the Services will no longer function. And, of course, you can revoke your consent by deleting Proofn from your mobile device (although we hope you do not do that).</li>
			<li><strong> Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.</strong> Like most online services, we use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that store information about your use of the Services, which can, among other things, help us see which areas and features of the Services are popular and let us count visits. Web beacons are small pieces of software on a webpage or email that help us see how you interact with that webpage or email. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please Keep in mind that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our Services. To learn more about how third parties use such technologies on our Services, be sure to read the &ldquo;Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others&rdquo; section of our privacy policy.</li>
			<li><strong> Website Log Information.</strong> We collect log file information when you use our websites and App. That information includes, among other things, your web browser and mobile browser type and language, access times, pages viewed, your IP address, and the website you visited before navigating to our websites.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Information We Collect From Other Sources</strong></p>
			<p>If another user allows us to collect information from his or her device phonebook and email account&mdash;and you&rsquo;re one of that user&rsquo;s contacts&mdash;we may combine the information we collect from that user&rsquo;s phonebook and email account with other information we have collected about you. We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with the information we collect through Proofn.</p>
			<p><strong>Information We Collect When You Contact Us</strong></p>
			<p>Whenever you have a question for our helpful Support team, just contact us on the Proofn. Of course, when you contact the Support team or communicate with us in any other way, we&rsquo;ll collect whatever information you volunteer. For instance, if you submit artwork, files, or any other materials to us through our websites, we will collect what you give us.</p>
			<p><strong>How We Use Information</strong></p>
			<p>What do we do with the information we collect? The short answer is: Provide you with an amazing set of Proofn Services that we will relentlessly improve on. But we do a lot more as well, such as:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Provide and deliver the items, services, and functionality that you request, process transactions, and send you related information;</li>
			<li>Communicate with you. That means just what it says; we may send you marketing communications on behalf of us or other companies; respond to your comments and questions; provide customer service; and send you technical notices, security alerts, and other informational email;</li>
			<li>Monitor and analyze trends and usage;</li>
			<li>Develop, improve, and refine items, services, and functionality;</li>
			<li>Personalize the Services in the future by providing advertisements, content, or features that match user profiles or interests. For instance, when you set up an account we may pre-populate certain account information based on the information we collect about you from other users;</li>
			<li>Verify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity; and</li>
			<li>Carry out any other purpose for which the information was collected.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Where Information Is Processed</strong></p>
			<p>Proofn is based in the United States. Although we welcome Proofn Users from all over the world, keep in mind that no matter where you live or where you happen to use our Services, you consent to the processing and transfer of information in and to the U.S. and other countries. We want you to know this because the laws of the United States and those of other countries where your information is processed might not be as comprehensive or protective as laws in the country where you live. And while you&rsquo;re in another country, know that your information may be made available to government or law enforcement requests.</p>
			<p><strong>How We Share Information</strong></p>
			<p>Here&rsquo;s the type of information we may share about you with others and how we do so:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>When you send an email, your recipients will see your name and, of course, whatever your email says or shows (whether that&rsquo;s a photo, video, text or document attachment.) When you view Proofn email, the sender, can edit, delete or remove content and attachments at anytime without providing notification to you of the changes the sender made. When you view Business Proofn email, the sender, can edit, delete or remove content and attachments anytime before the recipient(s) open the email without providing notification to you of the changes the sender made. We will let the sender know whether the recipient(s) opened your email or not, and if we detect that you captured a screenshot of the email, we will try to let the sender know that. If you ever want to change your payment information we let you do that as well through various settings.</li>
			<li>When you let us access your mobile phone device, we may share information about you with other users who have your phone number in their device phonebook.</li>
			<li>When you let us access your mobile device&rsquo;s email account, we may share information about you with other users who have your email in their email account.</li>
			<li>When other users view your profile, they will be able to view profile information, including your full name, profile photos</li>
			<li>If another user tries to interact with you through a feature that you&rsquo;re unable to use because you&rsquo;re too young&mdash;say, for instance, you don&rsquo;t meet the 18+ age requirement&mdash;we may tell the user that you&rsquo;re ineligible to use the feature, so that the user isn&rsquo;t left wondering why you never responded.</li>
			<li>We may share information about you with service providers who perform services on our behalf.</li>
			<li>With respect to jointly offered Services or functionality or services offered separately by other companies through our Services, we may share information about you with business partners to provide the Services and functionality you request and to communicate with you about those Services;</li>
			<li>We may share information about you in response to legal process or a request for information if we believe disclosure is consistent with, or required by, any applicable law, rule, or regulation; to investigate or remedy potential violations of our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of us, our users, or others; or in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
			<li>We may share information about you with your consent or at your direction, or as otherwise provided in this privacy policy.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We may also share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you.</p>
			<p>The Services may also contain third-party links or be a co-branded or third-party-branded Service that&rsquo;s being provided jointly with or by another company. By going to those links or by using a co-branded or third-party-branded Service, you may be providing personal information directly to the third party, us, or both. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your information. As always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party website or service that you visit or use, including those third parties you interact with through our Services.</p>
			<p><strong>Edit, Delete or Remove Sent Email </strong></p>
			<p>Delete, edit or removing email you sent along with attachments is the default setting when sending Proofn email to &ldquo;Clients/VIP&rdquo; contacts. That means that Proofn email along with attachments can be changed and/or deleted anytime during your 90-day free trial. After the 90-day free trial, we will charge $2.99 per contact to change or delete Proofn email, Business Proofn email to &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; contact(s) too.</p>
			<p>But&mdash;and this is important&mdash;you should understand that users who see your email can always save them, either by taking a screenshot or by using some other image-capture technology (whether that be software or even something as old-fashioned as a camera to take a photo of your device&rsquo;s screen). If we&rsquo;re able to detect that a recipient took a screenshot of an email you sent, we&rsquo;ll try to notify you. But the same common sense that applies to the Internet at large applies to Proofn as well: Don&rsquo;t send email that you wouldn&rsquo;t want someone to save or share.</p>
			<p>You can mark up to five (5) contacts as &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; and send Business Proofn email along with attachments that can be changed and/or deleted anytime before the recipient(s) open your Business Proofn email. For every subsequent contact you mark as &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; we will charge $2.99 per contact.</p>
			<p>You can also choose to send Non-Proofn email along with attachments that cannot be edited and deleted or removed later.</p>
			<p>A few final words on editing, deletion and removals on Proofn email sent to &ldquo;Clients/VIP&rdquo; contacts: We can&rsquo;t guarantee that email will be deleted or attachments removed within a specific timeframe. And even after we&rsquo;ve deleted email data or attachments from our servers, that same data or attachment may remain in backup for a limited period of time. We also sometimes receive requests from law enforcement requiring us by law to suspend our ordinary server-deletion practices for specific information. Finally, of course, as with any digital information, there may be ways to access email while still in temporary storage on recipients&rsquo; devices or, forensically, even after they are deleted.</p>
			<p><strong>Edit, Delete or Remove Sent Email to &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; Contacts</strong></p>
			<p>Change or remove email (along with attachments in the email) you sent before the recipient(s) open is the default when you send Business Proofn email to &ldquo;Client/VIP&rdquo; contacts.</p>
			<p>You can also choose to send Non-Proofn email along with attachments that cannot be edited and deleted or removed later.</p>

			<p><strong>Non-Proofn Email</strong></p>
			<p>You can always send Non-Proofn email at anytime before or after your 90-day free trial ends. Non-Proofn email means sending email and attachments that you cannot edit, delete or remove later.</p>
			<p><strong>Select Inbox Email to Automatically Delete 24 Hours later</strong></p>
			<p>You can mark 50 emails in your inbox that you want us to automatically delete on your behalf in 24 hours. When you mark over 50 emails in your inbox, we require a $.3.60 payment to mark an additional 50 emails in your inbox that you want us to automatically delete on your behalf in 24 hours. We will deduct the total payment amount from your credit card on file with us.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others</strong></p>
			<p>We may let other companies use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies on Proofn. These companies may collect information about how you use the Services and other websites and online services over time and across different services. The information collected may include unique device identifiers, device manufacturer and operating system, IP address, browser type, pages viewed, session start/stop time, links clicked, and conversion information. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand your online activity. Among the third parties we use for analytics is Google Analytics, which provides mobile analytics in connection with our app.</p>
			<p>Additionally, some companies may use the information they collect on our blog and other websites to deliver targeted advertisements on behalf of us or other companies, including on third-party websites and apps. Proofn does not currently respond to do-not-track signals that may be sent from your device. If we do so in the future, we will provide information about that practice in an updated version of this privacy policy.</p>
